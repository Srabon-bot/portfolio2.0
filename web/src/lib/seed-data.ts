    "I am a final-semester Computer Science student at the University of Information Technology and Sciences (UITS) in Dhaka. I build full-stack web applications with React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB — the kind of apps that solve real, everyday problems.",
    "My standout project is Haal Khata, a voice-first digital ledger for Bangladesh's neighborhood shopkeepers that speaks Bangla, English, and Korean. It won the grand prize at the KAIST training program. That project taught me how good engineering and local cultural context can produce something people genuinely need.",
    "I believe the best technology is grounded in the lives of the people who use it. I am especially interested in building tools with a direct Bangladeshi impact — and I also research deep learning models for flood forecasting in Bangladesh, though that is a secondary pursuit.",
